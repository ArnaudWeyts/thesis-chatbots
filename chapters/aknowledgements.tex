\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my 2 academic supervisors, Kristien Van Assche and Davy De Winne for their guidance, feedback and help during both the writing of this bachelor thesis and the connected Blended Mobility project.

Jordy Speeckaert deserves a word of thanks for the support and motivation as we worked on our theses together.

Finally I would also like to thank my family and girlfriend for their continuous encouragement and interest.
