\chapter{Case study overview}

To compare some existing frameworks, a simple proof of concept chatbot will be designed within this thesis. This chatbot will be a food ordering chatbot that offers the user a menu and takes in orders, similar to Domino's bot.

\section{Conversational state diagram}

To shape the bot, a conversational diagram needs to be created first. This diagram explains the main flow of the conversation, with the steps to reach the eventual purpose of the bot: in this case ordering food.
