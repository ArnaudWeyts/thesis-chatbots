\chapter*{Abstract}

Chatbots are becoming more and more significant as they provide an easy way to interact with any kind of knowledge or interface through a medium everyone is familiar with: conversation. With the rise of machine learning and natural language processing, platforms and frameworks have been created to take advantage of these improvements and develop chatbots easier, better and faster. This bachelor thesis will explore in what cases a chatbot can be a solution and what goes into building one. Two existing technologies, Microsoft's Bot Framework and Google's Dialogflow, will be researched and compared. Different factors, from their business plan up to detailed functionality throughout the development will be addressed.
